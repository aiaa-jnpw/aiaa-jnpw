## **About the Workshop**

The Jet Noise Prediction Workshop is organized to benchmark and advance high-fidelity CFD for jet noise predictions. Inspired by HLPW, DPW, and the High-Fidelity CFD Verification Workshop, it will provide:

- Common geometries and datasets
- Solver-to-solver comparisons
- Community best practices

## **Goals & Objectives**

<strong>1. Assess the Current State-of-the-Art</strong><br>
ðŸ”¹ Evaluate the numerical prediction capability (meshing, numerics, turbulence modeling, acoustic analogy, and HPC needs) of modern CFD solvers for subsonic and supersonic jet noise prediction.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Benchmark existing approaches against well-documented experimental datasets using standardized test cases.

<strong>2. Advance CFD-Based Jet Noise Prediction Methods</strong><br>
ðŸ”¹ Identify critical physical modeling and numerical fidelity requirements for accurate aeroacoustic predictions.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Promote development and validation of novel numerical methods, including LES, hybrid RANS/LES, and wall-modeled LES approaches.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Encourage integration of advanced post-processing tools such as Ffowcs Williamsâ€“Hawkings (FWH), SPOD, and other noise projection techniques.<br>

<strong>3. Establish Community Standards</strong><br>
ðŸ”¹ Develop common research models and well-characterized experimental configurations as reference cases.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Create standardized output formats, evaluation metrics, and post-processing conventions to enable solver-to-solver comparisons.<br>

<strong>4. Understand and Quantify Uncertainties</strong><br>
ðŸ”¹ Investigate the role of input uncertainty (boundary conditions, inflow turbulence, etc.) and numerical uncertainty (mesh resolution, subgrid models, etc.) in acoustic predictions.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Encourage the use of verification and validation practices to improve robustness and reproducibility.<br>

<strong>5. Facilitate Collaboration and Mutual Understanding</strong><br>
ðŸ”¹ Provide an impartial, pre-competitive forum for collaboration among experts in CFD, acoustics, and experimental aeroacoustics.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Bridge the gap between solver developers and end-users by enabling direct comparison of tools and methodologies.<br>

<strong>6. Enable Future Capability Growth</strong><br>
ðŸ”¹ Identify pacing items in numerical modeling, experiment-simulation coupling, and workflow integration that hinder widespread adoption of high-fidelity jet noise prediction.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Support the long-term goal of enabling certification by analysis for aeroacoustic performance in propulsion systems.<br>
