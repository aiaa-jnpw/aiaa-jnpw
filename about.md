# About the Workshop

The Jet Noise Prediction Workshop is organized to benchmark and advance high-fidelity CFD for jet noise predictions. Inspired by HLPW, DPW, and the High-Fidelity CFD Verification Workshop, it will provide:

- Common geometries and datasets
- Solver-to-solver comparisons
- Community best practices
