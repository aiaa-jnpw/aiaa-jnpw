## **What we envision for the workshop:**

The Jet Noise Prediction Workshop (JNPW) will proceed in three phases (Parts I–III), each concluding with a summit meeting timed to coincide with the AIAA Aviation and SciTech conferences (approximately every six months). Between those in‑person summits, virtual tag‑ups will provide a dedicated forum for participants to share progress and ongoing research—fostering active collaboration and driving the field forward.

---

## **Bi-weekly Virtual Tagups**
Regular bi-weekly meetings of registered workshop participants will be held to share updates, address technical questions, and ensure consistent progress throughout each phase.
