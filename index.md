## **Jet Noise Prediction Workshop (JNPW)**
Welcome to the website of the Jet Noise Prediction Workshop (JNPW). We are currently organizing the 1st workshop, which is planned to be held at AIAA SciTech 2027. A special session with early participants and pre-released reference cases is also being planned for AIAA Aviation and/or the AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics Conference in Brussels in 2026. We are in the process of assembling the organizing committee and look forward to bringing together experts from across the aeroacoustics and CFD communities.

The main goal of this workshop series is to assess the current state-of-the-art in CFD-based jet noise prediction, with a focus on evaluating computational methods against high-quality experimental data. The workshop is intended to provide an impartial forum for comparing numerical approaches, identifying limitations, and defining areas in need of further research and development.

We are currently developing the technical framework for the first workshop, including the definition of benchmark cases, evaluation metrics, and modeling guidelines. To promote technical depth and community engagement, we are considering the formation of focused working groups on key challenges.


## **Mission Statement**
The Jet Noise Prediction Workshop (JNPW) aims to establish a community-driven, standardized approach to evaluating and advancing CFD-based jet noise prediction methods. Through collaboration across academia, industry, and government, the workshop seeks to benchmark current capabilities, understand key sources of uncertainty, and accelerate the development of predictive tools for aeroacoustic analysis.

## **Goals & Objectives**

<strong>1. Assess the Current State-of-the-Art</strong><br>
🔹 Evaluate the numerical prediction capability (meshing, numerics, turbulence modeling, acoustic analogy, and HPC needs) of modern CFD solvers for subsonic and supersonic jet noise prediction.<br>
🔹 Benchmark existing approaches against well-documented experimental datasets using standardized test cases.

<strong>2. Advance CFD-Based Jet Noise Prediction Methods</strong><br>
🔹 Identify critical physical modeling and numerical fidelity requirements for accurate aeroacoustic predictions.<br>
🔹 Promote development and validation of novel numerical methods, including LES, hybrid RANS/LES, and wall-modeled LES approaches.<br>
🔹 Encourage integration of advanced post-processing tools such as Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FWH), SPOD, and other noise projection techniques.<br>

<strong>3. Establish Community Standards</strong><br>
🔹 Develop common research models and well-characterized experimental configurations as reference cases.<br>
🔹 Create standardized output formats, evaluation metrics, and post-processing conventions to enable solver-to-solver comparisons.<br>

<strong>4. Understand and Quantify Uncertainties</strong><br>
🔹 Investigate the role of input uncertainty (boundary conditions, inflow turbulence, etc.) and numerical uncertainty (mesh resolution, subgrid models, etc.) in acoustic predictions.<br>
🔹 Encourage the use of verification and validation practices to improve robustness and reproducibility.<br>

<strong>5. Facilitate Collaboration and Mutual Understanding</strong><br>
🔹 Provide an impartial, pre-competitive forum for collaboration among experts in CFD, acoustics, and experimental aeroacoustics.<br>
🔹 <p>Bridge the gap between solver developers and end-users by enabling direct comparison of tools and methodologies.<br>

<strong>6. Enable Future Capability Growth</strong><br>
🔹 Identify pacing items in numerical modeling, experiment-simulation coupling, and workflow integration that hinder widespread adoption of high-fidelity jet noise prediction.<br>
🔹 Support the long-term goal of enabling certification by analysis for aeroacoustic performance in propulsion systems.<br>
