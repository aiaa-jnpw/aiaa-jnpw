# Jet Noise Prediction Workshop (JNPW)

Welcome to the Jet Noise Prediction Workshop (JNPW) — a new AIAA community workshop dedicated to benchmarking and advancing CFD-based jet noise prediction.

Our mission is to develop standardized research cases, assess the current state-of-the-art in computational aeroacoustics, and foster collaboration among researchers and practitioners in academia, government, and industry.

## 🎯 Mission Statement

The Jet Noise Prediction Workshop (JNPW) aims to establish a community-driven, standardized approach to evaluating and advancing CFD-based jet noise prediction methods. Through collaboration across academia, industry, and government, the workshop seeks to benchmark current capabilities, understand key sources of uncertainty, and accelerate the development of predictive tools for aeroacoustic analysis.

## 📌 Goals & Objectives

### 1. Assess the Current State-of-the-Art
- Evaluate CFD solver performance for subsonic and supersonic jet noise predictions.
- Compare methods using standardized reference cases and experimental datasets.

### 2. Advance CFD-Based Jet Noise Prediction
- Encourage development of high-fidelity approaches (LES, HRLES, WMLES).
- Support innovation in post-processing techniques (FWH, SPOD, etc.).

### 3. Establish Community Standards
- Define shared input formats, boundary conditions, and metrics.
- Promote reproducibility and solver-to-solver comparability.

### 4. Understand and Quantify Uncertainties
- Explore sensitivity to boundary conditions, numerical setup, and turbulence models.
- Highlight robust V&V practices for aeroacoustic CFD.

### 5. Facilitate Collaboration
- Provide a neutral, pre-competitive forum for the aeroacoustics community.
- Strengthen links between experimentalists, CFD developers, and end-users.

### 6. Enable Future Capability Growth
- Identify modeling gaps and computational bottlenecks.
- Lay the foundation for eventual certification-by-analysis of noise emissions.
